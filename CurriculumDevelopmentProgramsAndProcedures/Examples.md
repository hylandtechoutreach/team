# Examples
Looking at examples of existing programs might be the best way to start learning how to contribute.

## Hy-Tech Camps
There are a variety of Hy-Tech Camp workshops, each with lesson plans available [here](https://github.com/hytechcamps/). These are meant to be a brief introduction to one concept, designed for about 2 hours in length. A few examples:

- [Animation for Games](https://github.com/hytechcamps/animation)

Student material for these workshops is surfaced via [hytechcamps.github.io](https://hytechcamps.github.io/).

## Hy-Tech Club
There are several [Hy-Tech Club courses](https://github.com/hytechclub/) available. These courses are designed to run for 12 weeks, with each week containing one ~2-hour session. Here are some examples:
