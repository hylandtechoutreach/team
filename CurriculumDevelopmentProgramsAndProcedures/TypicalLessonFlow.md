# Typical Lesson Flow
Most lessons follow a fairly standard structure.

## Icebreaker / Warm-Up
_An activity to kick off the lesson and motivate the students_

- This should be a fun way for the class to get to know each other better
- This can also be an opportunity to introduce the topics of the lesson
- For a multi-session program, this could be a review or practice activity
- This could also be a fun video with some relevance to computer science

### Example
[Here](https://hytechcamps.github.io/machine-learning/Icebreaker.html) is an example from the Machine Learning Hy-Tech Camp. Students have the opportunity to draw something using an AI-assisted drawing tool, and then share their drawings with the group while introducing themselves.

## Lecture
_A presentation (generally using PowerPoint) containing content for this week_

- The focus here is to familiarize students with concepts, even if they do not grasp them fully
- These should be interactive and include space to ask questions to the students (and have them ask questions)
- Some lessons are more PowerPoint-heavy, some do not require much
- It is preferable to add pictures, animations, videos, and other hooks to engage the students

### Example
[Here](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fhylandtechclub%2Ecom%3A443%2Fpy%2D201%2FCollections%2FCollections%2Epptx&wdSlideId=325&wdModeSwitchTime=1660652822326) is an example from the Python 201 Hy-Tech Club course. This one is a little longer, but involves some fun topics that students should hopefully enjoy.

## Formative Assessment
_A quick way to test if students retained any material from the lecture_

- These assessments help instructors figure out what the students learned well, and what topics may need review
- They are typically designed to be engaging for the students as well
- Generally, these are [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/), [Quizizz](https://quizizz.com/), or [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) quizzes
- They can also be other types of review games

### Examples
- [**Here is a Kahoot example.**](https://create.kahoot.it/share/d71c1d5e-a563-4e00-a61a-fa498c71942b). These are instructor-led, so the instructor should start the game, click through each question, and comment on the answers. They are more helpful for actually reviewing the material as a group.
- [**Here is a Quizizz example.**](https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/5c6ade2097b82c001a18541b). These are self-paced for the students, so all the instructor has to do is start the game. They are helpful for actually assessing the progress of each individual student. To run a Quizizz quiz, an account is required.
- [**Here is a Blooket example.**](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/62a0fa2f78f3c51ef02f8371). These are mostly self-paced for the students, but there are several different game options. They are generally meant to focus on the fun aspect, but can be very helpful when trying to practice rote memorization. To run a Blooket quiz, an account is required.
- [**Here is a PowerPoint Game example.**](https://github.com/hytechclub/web-101/blob/master/Week02/NameThatElement.pptx) This is one way to create a more customized review game experience. Instructions should be provided in the lesson's **README.md** file, or in the PowerPoint itself.

## Follow-Along Activity
_An Instructor-led, hands-on activity that should engage students_

- These should have clear instructions that both instructors and students can follow
- They should also contain explanations for the concepts covered; they should not simply list out the steps to follow
- The instructor should ask the students how to proceed during these activities
- These are often code-along activities, where students write the same code as the instructor (possibly with some customization)
- These can also be more general follow-along activities

### Examples
- [Here](https://hytechcamps.github.io/python/TurtleCodeAlong.html) is an example of a code-along from the Python Hy-Tech Camp. Note that code is available with each step, and the final code is provided at the end.
- [Here](https://hytechcamps.github.io/machine-learning/FollowAlong.html) is an example of a more general follow-along from the Machine Learning Hy-Tech Camp. Note that there are screenshots for the instructions to guide both instructors and students.

## Self-Paced Exercises & Challenges
_Exercises for students to complete on their own or with other students_

- During these exercises, students can ask for help from their peers or from instructors
- This is a good opportunity for instructors to help students on an individual basis
- All students should be able to complete the basic exercises, but no student should be able to complete all the challenges
- Depending on the type of program and the timing, these may make the most sense to cut

### Example
- [Here](https://hytechcamps.github.io/animation/AnimationChallenges.html) is an example of some challenges from the Animation Hy-Tech Camp. Note that there are several options - the instructions for some options are very open-ended, but for other options they are very specific. Students should be able to follow these instructions without any assistance from an instructor, so they must be clear and detailed (at least for the basic exercises).

## Wrap-Up
_A way to end the session_

- This can be an opportunity for students to complete a [feedback survey](https://forms.gle/wryBM9WGheDo6JPbA)
- This can be a great time for students to [share their work](https://hytechcamps.github.io/python/SharingWork.html)
- There may be an "exit ticket" or other review to close things out
- If there are any important closing remarks, they should be given here
